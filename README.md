AURA - E-commerce Platform for Artistic Paintings

Welcome to AURA, an innovative online marketplace designed for artists and art enthusiasts. AURA offers a platform where artists can showcase their creative paintings for sale or display, allowing users to explore a vast collection of art. Whether you're an artist looking to share your work with the world or a buyer searching for unique pieces to add to your collection, AURA provides an easy-to-navigate, user-friendly experience. The website is designed to provide a seamless experience with multiple pages that allow users to browse, view, and purchase artwork. Artists can manage their portfolio, while buyers can discover new and exciting pieces of art from a variety of styles and mediums.

Now, let's dive deeper into each page and explore its features and functionality!

1. The Shop Page (Done By Amr Saymeh, the Aura team leader):
   
   This page incorporates a range of features designed to provide an engaging and user-friendly experience. The "Shop Items Display" presents products dynamically and responsively, ensuring a visually               appealing layout. Users can easily select items for purchase with the "Add-to-Cart Functionality" and refine their browsing experience using the "Filter and Search options". To enhance usability, a "Night 
   Mode Switch" allows toggling between light and dark themes, catering to different user preferences. Built with Reusable Components in React, the page is highly scalable, and its Fully Responsive Design 
   ensures seamless operation across various devices, including mobiles and tablets. In this project, Amr's contributions included designing and implementing the Shop Page structure, developing the Add-to-Cart      Functionality, and building the Main Navigation Bar. He also created the Filter and Search Functionalities and designed the Night Mode Switch, integrating these features into the platform to enrich the user      experience.

2. The Profile Pages (Done By Sara Qadi):

   There are two pages: MyProfile and YourProfile, each designed with distinct functionalities.

   The MyProfile page features a profile picture, bio, follower and following counts, and an Edit Profile button that opens a modal for updating profile details. A settings icon provides access to user settings. 
   Posts are displayed in two categories: For Sale and For Show, with toggles to filter the display accordingly. Clicking on a post opens a modal showcasing the post's picture, a like section, and a comment 
   section where users can view and add comments. The left sidebar includes the website logo and navigation menu, offering links to other pages. One menu icon, Create Post, allows users to create new posts.  

   The YourProfile page mirrors the layout of MyProfile, but replaces the Edit Profile button with a Follow button for connecting with the user. The settings icon is replaced by a Message icon that opens a 
   messaging interface for direct communication with the profile owner. Both pages maintain a seamless user experience, combining personal content display with interactive features.

4. The Gallery Page (Done By Rand Fattash):

   This page uses a container to display image components seamlessly, regardless of their dimensions, ensuring a clean and engaging presentation. When a user clicks on an image, a modal pops up, providing 
   additional functionality. Within the modal, users can view detailed information about the image, including its story or inspiration, and even purchase it directly. This page exemplifies AURA's commitment to 
   combining aesthetic design with practical functionality, creating an immersive experience for art lovers.

5.  The Checkout Page (Done By Sojoud Qusini):

    The Checkout Page on AURA provides a seamless and secure way for users to complete their purchases. The page features an interactive form where users can enter their personal details, including name, email, 
    address, and payment information such as the name on the card, card number, and expiration date. When the "Proceed to Checkout" button is clicked, the form data is dynamically captured using useState and 
    stored in the invoice state. After submission, the page displays a detailed invoice containing the billing information (name and address) and payment details. To ensure security, only the last four digits of 
    the card number are shown. Additionally, the total amount due is prominently displayed, providing clarity for the user.
